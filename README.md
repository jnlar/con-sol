JavaScript console app, for learning purposes. ðŸ’»

- Session based JavaScript sandbox environment, each client get's their own locked down `window` object. *Maybe* secure I guess, uses [vm2](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2)
- [CodeMirror](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror) is used for the console input, still kinda broken (history traversal etc) but it does work ðŸ™‚
- Auto indentation (thanks to CodeMirror) when inside some type of encapuslation (curlies, parens etc)
